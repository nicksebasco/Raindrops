# Raindrops
A simple game in which the user attempts to solve basic math problems contained within raindrops before they hit the ground.  Each time a raindrop hits the ground the water level in the game container will rise until the water reaches the top of the conatiner, at which point the game will be over.  The math problems are rather trivial with the exception of 2-digit squares.

Project Goals (To-Do's):

1. Incorporate non trivial mental calculations such as basic derivatives, integration, 2x2 systems of equations, .. etc.
2. Generate multiple raindrops at at time.
3.  Clean up css with less.  I briefly cleaned up the js code; however, this was literally one of my first projects I created when learning js/html/css, so the code could definitely use more abstraction, better commenting, etc.
4.  Create levels corresponding to difficulty and calculation type.
5.  Make levels get progressively harder

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
