# Raindrops
A simple game in which the user attempts to solve basic math problems contained within raindrops before they hit the ground.  Each time a raindrop hits the ground the water level in the game container will rise until the water reaches the top of the conatiner, at which point the game will be over.  The math problems are rather trivial with the exception of 2-digit squares.
