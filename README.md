# Raindrops
A simple game in which the user attempts to solve basic math problems contained within raindrops before they hit the ground.  Each time a raindrop hits the ground the water level in the game container will rise until the water reaches the top of the conatiner, at which point the game will be over.  The math problems are rather trivial with the exception of 2-digit squares.

Project Goals (To-Do's):

1. Incorporate non trivial mental calculations such as basic derivatives, integration, 2x2 systems of equations, .. etc.
2. Generate multiple raindrops at at time.
3.  Clean up css with less.  I briefly cleaned up the js code; however, this was literally one of my first projects I created when learning js/html/css, so the code could definitely use more abstraction, better commenting, etc.
4.  Create levels corresponding to difficulty and calculation type.
⋅⋅⋅Make levels get progressively harder
